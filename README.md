# 🏡 Blockchain-Based Land Registry System

## 📘 Project Description
This project aims to create a decentralized land registry system using blockchain technology. It allows government authorities to register land plots and citizens to verify ownership or transfer land without the risk of manipulation or fraud. Smart contracts ensure security, transparency, and immutability.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To eliminate land fraud, reduce corruption, and digitize land ownership records in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner using blockchain technology.

## ✨ Key Features
- ✅ **Admin-Controlled Land Registration**: Only authorized admin can register new land records on-chain.
- 🔄 **Secure Land Transfers**: Owners can transfer land to others seamlessly through the contract.
- 🔍 **Ownership History**: Tracks who owns what in a tamper-proof format.
- 📄 **Land Metadata**: Stores location, size, and owner data securely.
- 🔐 **Access Control**: Enforces admin and owner permissions with modifiers.
- ⚙️ **Event Logging**: Emits events on land registration and transfer for tracking and frontend integration.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🌐 **Integration with IPFS** for storing legal documents like land deeds.
- 🧠 **AI-based fraud detection** using historical transaction patterns.
- 🏛️ **Government Onboarding**: Direct integration with municipal or national databases.
- 📲 **Mobile & Web DApps** for user-friendly interaction with the blockchain.
- ⛓️ **Multi-chain support** using cross-chain protocols.
